The Site is made using Vanilla Javascript only without any external packages or frameworks.

The balls are of variable radius and have variable velocity along the axes. They collide with the walls and rebound without any energy loss.

If the balls are within a 50 radius of the mouse cursor, their radius increases gradually to an upper-limit and gradually decreases to their original size when the mouse moves away.
